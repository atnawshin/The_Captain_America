                    Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the
                    release
                    of the 1944 movie serial, Captain America. Since then, the character has been featured in a variety
                    of
                    films and other media. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Steve Rogers was portrayed by Chris Evans.

                <p>The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he carries a nearly-indestructible
                    shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail
                    young
                    artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after
                    joining
                    the military to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. </p>
